# **Phishing URL Detection Tool**

## Overview
This tool analyzes domain names to detect potential phishing attempts. It retrieves WHOIS information, checks for homograph attacks, and intendifies hosting details to helpusers assess whether a domain might be suspicious. 

## Features
- **WHOIS Lookup** â€“ Retrieves domain registration details, including creation date, registrar, and status.  
- **Domain Age Check** â€“ Warns if a domain is newly registered (less than a year old).  
- **Homograph Attack Detection** â€“ Identifies potential phishing domains that use lookalike characters (e.g., `g00gle.com`).  
- **Hosting Information** â€“ Retrieves the domain's hosting country and organization. 

## ðŸš€ Installation & Usage  

### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed. You will also need the following dependencies:  

```bash
pip install python-whois tldextract requests
```

### To run script on terminal:
python phishingDetector.py
Then enter the domain to be scanned and review potential wrning s or security concerns.

## Limitatins & Warnings
- This tool is for education and research purposes only.  It should not be relied upon for securing sensitive information.
- The detection methods do not guarantee absolute accuracyâ€”a site flagged as "safe" may still be malicious. This tool only checks for basic safety measuremnts. 
- WHOIS data availability depends on registry policies; some domains may not provide full details.
- Homograph detection is basic and does not account for advanced Unicode-based attacks.
- The tool does not scan website contentâ€”it only analyzes domain characteristics.

### Ethical Considerations & Responsable Use
This tool is designed to help users understand domain security risks, but it must be used responsibly:

- Use it for learning, cybersecurity awareness, or personal safety.
- Do not use this tool for malicious purposes, such as attempting to identify targets for phishing.
- Do not assume absolute security based on resultsâ€”always combine this with other security measures.
- Respect privacy lawsâ€”retrieving WHOIS data should be done within legal and ethical boundaries.
